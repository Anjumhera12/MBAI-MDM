* **Admins** have full access to all features, including managing users and overseeing the platform's functionality. 

* **Data Stewards** have limited access, focusing specifically on tasks related to data stewardship, ensuring data accuracy and compliance without the ability to manage users or broader administrative functions.

* **Fulfilment role** enables users to perform **bulk match operations**, streamlining the process of identifying and consolidating matching records across large datasets.  

11.	The system provides a logout option, located on the right side of the interface. Users can log out by simply clicking the **Logout** option, ensuring a seamless and secure sign-out process from the platform.
